# Use Terrain with the testnet

The [Pisco testnet](../../learn/glossary.md#testnet) is used for testing transactions on the Terra network.

## Prerequisites

- [Install the Terra Station browser extension](../../learn/terra-station/download/terra-station-extension.md)

## Create a Pisco wallet

[Create a new wallet](../../learn/terra-station/download/terra-station-extension.md#create-a-wallet) using the Terra Station extension. It's recommended that you name this wallet "Pisco" or "testnet" so it's easy to remember.

After creating a Pisco wallet and storing the seed phrase, request funds from the testnet faucet:

Make sure you have your seed phrase stored somewhere. You will need it to complete this tutorial.

# Counter tutorial

After creating a testnet wallet, you are ready to use Terrain. This short tutorial walks you through setting up your project and creating a simple counter that increments upon request.

## 1. Scaffold your dApp

Scaffold your new application:

```sh
terrain new my_terra_dapp
cd my_terra_dapp
npm install
```

### Project structure

The following structure shows your scaffolded project:

```
.
├── contracts              # The contracts' source code.
│   ├── my_terra_dapp
│   └── ...                # Add more contracts here.
├── frontend               # The front-end application.
├── lib                    # Predefined functions for task and console.
├── tasks                  # Predefined tasks.
├── keys.terrain.js        # Keys for signing transactions.
├── config.terrain.json    # Config for connections and contract deployments.
└── refs.terrain.json      # Deployed code and contract references.
```

## 2. Configure the testnet

Before deploying, Terrain needs to learn how to access your Pisco wallet. To do this you'll need to modify `keys.terrain.js` in the generated project.

Modify the configuration and input your seed phrase to look like this:

```
module.exports = {
  pisco: {
    mnemonic:
      "PLACE_YOUR_PISCO_SEED_PHRASE_HERE",
  },
};
```

## 3. Deploy

To deploy the application, run the following command:

```sh
terrain deploy my_terra_dapp --signer pisco --network testnet
```

The deploy command performs the following steps automatically:

- Builds the counter smart contract.
- Optimizes the counter smart contract.
- Uploads counter smart contract to testnet.
- Instantiates the deployed smart contract.


<Admonition type="caution" title="Warning">

If you get the following error:

```
CLIError: account sequence mismatch, expected 1, got 0: incorrect account sequence
```

Wait a few seconds then try the deploy command again.

## 3. Generate TypeScript client

Terrain 0.5.x and above includes the ability to automatically generate a TypeScript client based on your smart contract schema.

Generating a client is easy, just run the following command:

```
terrain contract:generateClient my_terra_dapp --build-schema
```

The generated client will be put in `./lib/clients` and copied to the frontend.

## 4. Interact with the deployed contract

The Terrain template comes with several predefined helpers in `lib/index.js`. Use them to start interacting with your smart contract:

1. Run `terrain console --network testnet --signer pisco`.

2. With the console open, increment the counter by running the following:

```JavaScript
await lib.increment();
```

You can get the current count by using:

```JavaScript
await lib.getCount()
```

3. After incrementing once, `await lib.getCount()` will return:

```JSON
{ count: 1 }
```

## 5. Front-end scaffolding

Terrain also scaffolds a very simple front-end.

1. In the Terra Station Chrome extension, [switch the network to `testnet`](../../learn/terra-station/testnet.md).

2. To use the front end, run the following commands in order.

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

3. With `testnet` selected in Terra Station you can now increment and reset the counter from the front end.
