If this is your first time using Terra Station, follow the [Terra Station tutorial](download/terra-station-desktop.md).

## Get testnet Luna
1. Open Terra Station and connect your wallet.
2. In the bottom left corner of Terra Station, switch **Mainnet** to **Testnet**.
2. Copy your wallet address. Your wallet address will appear at the top of the Terra station Desktop app near your wallet name. Your wallet address will look like this: `terra<random-numbers-and-letters>`
3. Open your browser and navigate to the [Terra Faucet <img src="/img/Faucet.svg" height="20px">](https://faucet.terra.money).
4. Paste your Terra address in the **Testnet address** field, select Luna, and click **Send me tokens**.

You now have funds in your Testnet wallet. Use the testnet just like you would use the mainnet. Make sure to switch back to the mainnet to make real transactions.
