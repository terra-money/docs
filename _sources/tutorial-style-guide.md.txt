# Tutorial style guide

Tutorials are guides that walk users through specific actions to achieve a goal. Tutorials should start from scratch. Tutorials should teach the basics of getting started and include one real-world example of a specific action. 

For more information on tutorials, visit the [Diataxis framework site](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/)

## Audience

The audience for a tutorial is a complete beginner. Do not assume any prerequisites, other than the very basics: they have a terminal and a code editor installed, and they know how to copy, paste, and press enter. All other instructions should be written out. Any required dependencies or installations should be included in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

Users of a tutorial should be able to walk through an entire tutorial and complete a specific task.

## Writing style

Tutorials are written in inviting and clear language. Tutorials should include the necessary information to help a user achieve a specific task. Tutorials start from the beginning and do not assume prior knowledge of the subject. 

Tutorials are action-oriented. Try not to include information that is not necessary to the action being described. If you want to include supplemental information, create an [explanation](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/) page and link out to it. 

### Simplicity

Simplicity is at the heart of the Terra style. Writers and readers will understand each other better with a minimalist writing approach. Writing in this style does not mean that you should be less descriptive or vague. It means that clarity is emphasized over complexity. 

Writing in shorter sentences can give your writing more clarity. Try to limit the number of clauses in a sentence. Simplify your language. Avoid jargon. 

Blocks of text are daunting and are usually left unread in action-based tutorials. Instead, limit paragraphs to three sentences. 

Remember, you are writing to show off the functionality of Terra, and not using Terra to show off your writing. 

Readability is key. 

## Voice

All writing in the Terra docs is written in second or third person. 

First-person language such as "I," "we," "us," or "let's" should be avoided in all situations. 

**Examples**: 
- "We recommend," becomes "it is recommended."
- "Let's use the following command," becomes "use the following command."
- "Our project," becomes "your project."

## Structure

### Title

Titles are written using sentence-style capitalization. The first word of a title is always capitalized. Most tutorials should be labeled `# Get started with ____` or `# ____ tutorial` . 

Titles should clearly reflect what the tutorial is about. Use imperatives in titles rather than gerunds.

**Example**: 
"# Starting The LCD" 
becomes 
"# Start the LCD" 

### Intro

The intro is a brief, 2-3 sentence introduction to the tutorial. You can include a basic overview of the tutorial in the intro. 

**Example**:

"Terrad is the command line interface and node daemon for interacting with the Terra blockchain. In this tutorial, you will learn how to install Terrad, make a query, and..."


### Prerequisites

The prerequisite section should be at the top of the tutorial below the intro. This section should include all relevant dependencies necessary for completing the tutorial. List out prerequisites as links to a URL. Use an unordered list. List specific version numbers if necessary. All prerequisites for the tutorial should be listed in this section. Avoid ambushing users mid-tutorial with dependencies that aren't listed in the prerequisites. 

**Example**:

   ```md
   ## Prerequisites
   
   - [Install Terra.js](link-to-Station-installation)
   - [Create a wallet](link-to-wallet-tutorial)
   - [Node v17.0.0](link-to-installation-guide)
   - ...
   
   ```

### Steps

The steps make up the body of a tutorial. Step headings are numbered and describe the actions outlined in each step. 

If a step contains more than one specific action, it should be broken up into substeps. Number all substeps using an [ordred list](#ordered-lists).

Try to limit substeps to 7. Never have more than 10. Create a new step to break things up. 

**Example**:

   ```md
   ## 1. Set up your environment

   Before you can begin making transactions, you will need to scaffold your application.

   1. Use the following command to create a directory for your project:

      ```sh
      mkdir my-terra-dapp
      ```

   2. Enter your project directory and run `npm install`:

      ```sh
      cd my-terra-dapp
      npm install
      ```

   ```

See the [headings](#headings) section for more information.

### Endings

Congratulate users upon completing a tutorial. A good tutorial will leave a user feeling accomplished. Provide a user with a direction for the next steps after completing a tutorial. 

**Example**: Congratulations! You've just written your first Terra tutorial. To learn more about technical documentation, visit the [diataxis guides](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/).

## Formatting

Markdown takes the guesswork out of formatting. Rely on Markdown to format and standardize your documentation. Do not use special HTML code to format text. The point of Markdown is to be consistent. Do not use breaks `<br/>` unless absolutely necessary. Avoid using lines to denote sections. Headings denote sections. 

Limiting your styling will make your writing clearer and more succinct.

### Filenames

Name all your files using lower case. Use dashes if necessary. Do not use spaces or underscores. Keep filenames succinct.

### Code

Code should be in blocks. A command that a user needs to execute should be written in a code block rather than inline. Use `inline code` to refer to specific parts of code. 

**Example**:  Use the `start` command to run the application:

```sh
npm start
```

Use notes in code blocks sparingly, if at all. Most notes should be written above the code block. Annotations should be reserved for long code blocks. 

Code blocks in tutorials should be written so that a user can copy and paste them directly into their terminal using the copy button on each code block. 

Avoid using multiple commands in a code block. Commands should be separated and listed as substeps. 

### Inline code

Code mentioned outside of code blocks should always be written in tick marks exactly as it appears.

**Example**:  

Use the `k.FunctionExapmle` function to create an example. 

Avoid starting sentences with code, as it makes capitalization and punctuation difficult. Never alter the punctuation or capitalization of code. Write it exactly as it appears. 

**Example**:  

All code goes inside `tick` marks, even when referring to specific `variables`.

### Examples

Examples are denoted in the following format:

**Example**: You can put a short intro to the example here. 

This is an example. 

### Headings

Headings denote sections in a document. Each page should contain only one first-level heading as its title. Headings below the title can be nested. Do not skip heading levels. 

Headings that denote chronological steps are numbered. Headings used to denote non-chronological sections, such as explanations or stand-alone information, are not numbered.

All headings follow sentence-style capitalization. Avoid starting a heading with in-line code. Headings should not have ending punctuation. 

Level 1 headings should only be used for titles. 

Try to use only three heading levels. Do not use more than 4 levels. 

**Example**:
``` md
# Title heading only
## Level 2
### Level 3 
#### Avoid using level 4 headings
##### Never use more than 4 levels

```

### Lists

#### Ordered lists

1. Any steps that need to be completed sequentially are ordered.

2. Ordered lists must contain at least two steps. 

#### Unordered lists

- Use unordered lists to list non-sequential information.
- Use sentence-style capitalization and punctuation in unordered lists. 
- Unordered lists must contain at least two components. 

### Text styles

Don't use italics. Bold is used in the following cases:

- When referring to interface buttons. "Click **Send**."
- When denoting [examples](#examples). 

Ending punctuation is never stylized or included in links. 

**Example**: Open the window and click **Next**. Select a fee to submit a [transaction](link).

### Links

Use descriptive text for links. Avoid using "here" as a placeholder.  All links are written in markdown format. 

**Example**:

Incorrect: For more examples, click [here](example.com).

Correct: For more examples, visit the [example page](example.com). 

Descriptive links help the user understand where they are going.

### Punctuation

Simplify your writing. While tempting, em dashes promote unnecessary complexity and ambiguous grammar. 

Use the Oxford comma. 

Punctuation integral to a sentence should never be styled or included in a link.

**Examples**:

Period outside of link: 
"Visit the [example page](example.com). "

Commas outside of code: 
"The three commands are `start`, `end`, and `help`. 

### Notes and admonitions

All notes, warnings, tips, or other admonitions must be written in an admonition box. Don't use subtext or other formatting elements. If a note is important, it goes in a box. If it is not important, leave it out. 

Try to use custom titles for all admonitions. 

**Example**:

:::{admonition} Writing admonitions

Admonitions are brief and direct. They provide important information to the user. Don't overuse admonitions.
