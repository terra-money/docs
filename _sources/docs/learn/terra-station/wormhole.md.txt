# Wormhole Bridge tutorial

Wormhole's Portal Bridge allows you to bridge tokens across different chains. Instead of swapping or converting assets directly, Wormhole locks your source assets in a smart contract and mints new Wormhole-wrapped assets on the target chain. You can then swap Wormhole-wrapped assets on an exchange for other assets on the target chain. 

Use this tutorial to bridge your assets between Terra and other chains using Wormhole.

## Prerequisites

- [The Terra Station browser extension](../terra-station/download/terra-station-chrome.md) for tokens on the Terra blockchain.
- A wallet on the chain you want to bridge. 

   :::{admonition} Paying for fees
   :class: tip
   Be sure to have enough tokens in your wallets to pay for fees. Remember that fees will be charged for sending and redeeming tokens.
