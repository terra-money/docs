:::{admonition} Avoid unnecessary proposals
:class: caution
To prevent unnecessary proposals or abuse of the system, all governance proposals must obtain a minimum deposit of 512 Luna. If 33.4% of the total vote is `NoWithVeto`, `quorum` is not met, or the minimum deposit isn't reached, the deposit will be burned. All other vote outcomes get their deposits refunded. For more information on deposits and refunds, visit the [governance overview](../protocol.md#governance).
