# Mnemonic safety

## What is a mnemonic/seed phrase?

A mnemonic is a unique list of 24 words used to generate your wallet account. You can think of a mnemonic, or seed phrase, as a master key to your account. Anyone who has access to your mnemonic has access to your money. It's important to keep your mnemonic safe. 

Mnemonics, also known as seed phrases, play an important role in the creation of accounts and wallets on the Terra blockchain. For more information on wallets, seeds, and accounts, visit the [Cosmos docs](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/basics/accounts.html).

## How can I store my mnemonic?

### Mnemonic storage best practices

1. Treat your mnemonic like cash.

2. Always write down your mnemonic using pen and paper. 

3. Number your mnemonic list.

4. Verify your mnemonic backwards. 

5. Never store your mnemonic on a digital device. 

Mnemonics should be stored in a safe, secure place. 

6. Do not share your mnemonic with anyone. 

7. Don't make copies. 

8. Make it difficult to access your mnemonic. 

9. Only enter your mnemonic as a last resort. 

 Treat your mnemonic like you would treat physical money. 
Mnemonics are spelling and order sensitive, so be sure to spell and order each word correctly. 

## When Should I use my mnemonic?

You should only use your mnemonic if you have lost access to your wallet on any of your devices.
