   :class: danger
   Anyone who gains access to your seed phrase can access the contents of the corresponding wallet. Be cognizant of the fact that there is no recourse for theft of a seed phrase. To protect your seed phrase, consider the following tips:
   - Never save or store your seed phrase as a digital file on any device.
   - Always write down your seed phrase with a pen and paper.
   - Store the paper with your seed phrase on it somewhere safe.
   - Never give your seed phrase to anyone, not even support staff.

## Receive tokens from an exchange

1. Purchase your tokens using an exchange that supports Terra.

2. Withdraw any token supported by the Terra network from your exchange. Every exchange will be different and one should visit the web page of their preferred exchange for details on how to withdraw tokens. Use the following steps as a generic guide.

    1. To receive tokens to your wallet, use your wallet address. To copy your wallet address, just click on the name of your wallet in the upper right-hand corner of the app and click on **COPY** just below the address.  Your wallet address will take the following form: `terra<random-numbers-and-letters>`

    2. Double-check that your submitted address matches the address of the wallet where you would like to receive funds.

    3. Send the tokens from the exchange to your Terra Station wallet address.

    :::{admonition} Waiting times for transfers
    :class: warning
    When you transfer tokens from an exchange to Terra, it will take some time for the tokens to appear in your wallet. Don't panic. This waiting period is normal and varies depending on the exchange used. If a transfer does not appear immediately, check back after some time.
    :::

## Send tokens

1. Open the Terra Station mobile app and connect to your wallet.

2. Tap on the token under **Coins** that you want to send.  

3. Enter the address of the wallet you want to send tokens to.  

4. Enter the amount you want to send. You can also add a memo to specify what the transaction is for.  

5. Verify the recipient address and transaction amount. Remember to always maintain some funds in your wallet in order to be able to carry out further transactions.

6.  Enter your password and tap **Submit**. Wait for the transaction to process. This generally takes a few seconds.

   :::{admonition} Maintain funds for transaction fees
   :class: warning
   It is recommended to maintain some funds in your wallet in order to be able to pay for transaction fees. Without available capital for fee payment, you will not be able to carry out further transactions until more tokens are transferred to your wallet.
