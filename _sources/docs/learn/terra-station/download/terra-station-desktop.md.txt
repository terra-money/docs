   :::{admonition} Protect your seed phrase
   :class: danger
   Anyone with your seed phrase can access your money, and there is no recourse for someone stealing your seed phrase. To protect your seed phrase, consider the following tips:

   - Never save or store your seed phrase as a digital file on any device.
   - Always write down your seed phrase with a pen and paper.
   - Store the paper with your seed phrase on it somewhere safe.
   - Never give your seed phrase to anyone, not even support staff.

Congratulations! You have just created a Terra Station wallet.

## Receive tokens from an exchange

1. Purchase your tokens using any exchange that supports Luna.

2. Withdraw any token supported by the Terra network from your exchange. Every exchange is different. Please visit your exchange's web page for guides on how to withdraw tokens. Use the following steps as a generic guide.

    1. To receive tokens to your wallet, use your wallet address. Your wallet address will appear at the top of the Terra station Desktop app near your wallet name. Your wallet address will look like this: `terra<random-numbers-and-letters>`

    2. Double-check your wallet address is correct before sending.

    3. Send the tokens from the exchange to your Terra Station wallet address.

   :::{admonition} Waiting times for transfers
   :class: caution
   When you transfer tokens from an exchange to Terra, some time will pass before the tokens appear in your wallet. Don't panic. This waiting period is normal and varies depending on the exchange. If a transfer does not appear immediately, check back after some time.
   :::

Now you have tokens on Terra!

## Stake Luna

Stake your Luna to a validator to start earning rewards. Before you stake, make sure you have Luna in your wallet. You can transfer Luna from an [exchange](#receive-tokens-from-an-exchange) or [another wallet](../send.md).

1. Open Terra Station and click **Stake**.

2. Select a Validator and click on their name in the **Moniker** column of the validator list.

   ```{image} /img/screens/desktop/stake-page.png
   :class: sd-p-3
   ```


3. In the **My delegations** section, click **Delegate**. A new window will appear.

   ```{image} /img/screens/desktop/stake-validator.png
   :class: sd-p-3
   :width: 150 px
   ```

4. In the **Amount** field, specify the amount of Luna you want to delegate and specify which coin you want to pay fees with. 

   ```{image} /img/screens/desktop/stake-delegate.png
   :class: sd-p-3
   ```

   :::{admonition} Keep coins for fees
   :class: warning
   Always keep some coins to pay fees with. Never stake your entire wallet amount. Without money for fees, you can't make any transactions.
   :::

5. Double-check the amounts and fees. Enter your password and click **Submit**.

Congratulations, you've just delegated Luna!

## Withdraw staking rewards

Rewards start accruing the moment you stake Luna. Monitor your rewards in the staking section of Terra Station. Once you have sufficient rewards, follow these steps to withdraw them:


   ```{image} /img/screens/desktop/stake-page.png
   :class: sd-p-3
   ```

1. Open Terra Station and click **Stake**.

2. To claim all rewards, click **Withdraw all rewards** in the upper right corner of the staking page. To withdraw rewards only from a single validator, click on their name in the list and click **withdraw** on their page.

3. Review the amounts, enter your password, and click **withdraw**.

Congratulations, you've just withdrawn your staking rewards!

## Send tokens

1. Open the Terra Station desktop app and connect to your wallet.

2. Click **Wallet** in the navigation bar.

3. Click **Send** next to the token you want to send.

   ```{image} /img/screens/desktop/send-wallet.png
   :class: sd-p-3
   ```

4. Enter the address of the wallet you want to send tokens and the amount you want to send. You can also add a memo for the transaction.

   ```{image} /img/screens/desktop/send-submit.png
   :class: sd-p-3
   ```

7. Verify the transaction amounts and address. Remember to always leave enough tokens in your account for other transactions.

8.  Enter your password and click **Submit**.

After a few moments, the tokens will appear in the receiver's wallet.
