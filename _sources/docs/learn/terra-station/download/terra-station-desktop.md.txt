   :::{admonition} Protect your seed phrase
   :class: danger
   Anyone who gains access to your seed phrase can access the contents of the corresponding wallet. Be cognizant of the fact that there is no recourse for theft of a seed phrase. To protect your seed phrase, consider the following tips:
   - Never save or store your seed phrase as a digital file on any device.
   - Always write down your seed phrase with a pen and paper.
   - Store the paper with your seed phrase on it somewhere safe.
   - Never give your seed phrase to anyone, not even support staff.

## Receive tokens from an exchange

1. Purchase your tokens using [an exchange that supports Luna](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna-v2/markets/).

2. Withdraw any token supported by the Terra network from your exchange. Every exchange will be different and you should visit the web page of their preferred exchange for details on how to withdraw tokens. Use the following steps as a generic guide.

    1. To receive tokens to your wallet, use your wallet address. To copy your wallet address, just click on the name of your wallet in the upper right-hand corner of the app and click on **COPY** just below the address.  Your wallet address will take the following form: `terra<random-numbers-and-letters>`

    2. Double-check that your submitted address matches the address of the wallet where you would like to receive funds.

    3. Send the tokens from the exchange to your Terra Station wallet address.

    :::{admonition} Waiting times for transfers
    :class: warning
    When you transfer tokens from an exchange to Terra, it will take some time for the tokens to appear in your wallet. Don't panic. This waiting period is normal and varies depending on the exchange used. If a transfer does not appear immediately, check back after some time.

## Stake Luna

Stake your Luna to a validator to start earning rewards. Before you stake, make sure you have Luna in your wallet. You can transfer Luna from an [exchange](#receive-tokens-from-an-exchange) or from [another wallet](../send.md).

1. Open Terra Station and click **Stake**.

2. Select a Validator and click on their name in the **Moniker** column of the validator list.

   ```


3. In the **My delegations** section, click **Delegate** and a new window will appear.

4. In the **Amount** field, specify the amount of Luna you want to delegate.

   ```

   :::{admonition} Maintain funds for transaction fees
   :class: warning
   It is recommended to maintain some funds in your wallet for future transactions. Without available capital for fee payment, you will not be able to carry out further transactions until more tokens are transferred to your wallet.
   :::

5. Double-check the amounts and fees, enter your password, and click **Submit**.

Congratulations, you've just delegated Luna!

## Withdraw staking rewards

Rewards start accruing the moment you stake your Luna. Monitor your rewards in the staking section of Terra Station. Once you have sufficient rewards, follow these steps to withdraw them:

1. Open Terra Station and click **Stake**.

2. To claim all rewards, click **Withdraw all rewards** in the upper right corner of the staking page. To withdraw rewards from a single validator, click on their name in the Validators list and then click on **Withdraw rewards** in the Validator details page.

   ```{image} /img/screens/desktop/stake-page.png
   :class: sd-p-3
   :align: center
   ```

3. Review the amounts, enter your password, and click **Submit**.

Congratulations, you've just withdrawn your staking rewards!

## Send tokens

1. Open the Terra Station desktop app and connect to your wallet.

2. Click **Wallet** in the navigation bar.

3. Click **Send** next to the token you want to send.

   ```{image} /img/screens/desktop/send-wallet.png

   ```

4. Enter the address of the wallet where you would like to send the tokens and the amount you would like to send. You can also add a memo to specify what the transaction is for.

   ```{image} /img/screens/desktop/send-submit.png
   :class: sd-p-3
   :align: center
   ```

7. Verify the recipient address and the amount before submitting the transaction. Remember to always maintain some funds in your wallet for future transactions.

8.  Enter your password and click **Submit**.

After a few moments, the tokens will appear in the recipient's wallet.

   :::{admonition} Maintain funds for transaction fees
   :class: warning
   It is recommended to maintain some funds in your wallet for future transactions. Without available capital for fee payment, you will not be able to carry out further transactions until more tokens are transferred to your wallet.
