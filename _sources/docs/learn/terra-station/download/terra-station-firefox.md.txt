This tutorial walks you through how to install and use the Terra Station extension for the Firefox browser.

## Prerequisites

- Download [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

## Install the Terra Station extension

1. Open your Firefox browser and visit [the Terra Station Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/terra-station-wallet/).

2. Install the extension and add it to your browser.

## Create a wallet

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a new wallet on the Terra Station Firefox extension. To connect to an existing wallet, you may view the instructions on how to [recover a wallet](../wallet.md#connect-to-a-wallet-using-a-private-key).

1. Open the browser extension and click **New wallet**.

2. Type in a secure wallet name and password.

3. Confirm your password.

4. Using a pen and paper, write down your 24-word seed phrase exactly as it appears. Number each word to make verifying easier.

   :::{admonition} Protect your seed phrase
   :class: danger
   Anyone who gains access to your seed phrase can access the contents of the corresponding wallet. Be cognizant of the fact that there is no recourse for theft of a seed phrase. To protect your seed phrase, consider the following tips:
   - Never save or store your seed phrase as a digital file on any device.
   - Always write down your seed phrase with a pen and paper.
   - Store the paper with your seed phrase on it somewhere safe.
   - Never give your seed phrase to anyone, not even support staff.

5. Verify the written seed phrase to ensure every word is spelled correctly and that each word is in the correct order.

6. Check the box to confirm that your seed phrase has been written down and click **Submit**.

7. Confirm your seed phrase by selecting the correct words in each prompt and click **Submit**.

8. Click **Connect** to connect to your new wallet.

Congratulations! You have just created a Terra Station wallet.

## Buy tokens from an exchange

1. Once a wallet is connected, one can click **Buy** next to any token listed to purchase tokens utilizing an exchange that supports Terra.

2. Select your preferred exchange to be forwarded to the trading page for the previously selected token.

3. Withdraw any token supported by the Terra network from your exchange. Every exchange will be different and one should visit the web page of their preferred exchange for details on how to withdraw tokens. Use the following steps as a generic guide.

    1. To receive tokens to your wallet, use your wallet address. Your wallet address will appear at the top of the Terra Station Firefox extension just below your wallet name. Your wallet address will take the following form: `terra<random-numbers-and-letters>`

    2. Double-check that your submitted address matches the address of the wallet where you would like to receive funds.

    3. Send the tokens from the exchange to your Terra Station wallet address.

    :::{admonition} Waiting times for transfers
    :class: warning
    When you transfer tokens from an exchange to Terra, it will take some time for the tokens to appear in your wallet. Don't panic. This waiting period is normal and varies depending on the exchange used. If a transfer does not appear immediately, check back after some time.

## Send tokens

1. Open the Terra Station Firefox extension and connect to your wallet.

2. Click **Send** next to the token you want to send.

3. Enter the address of the wallet you want to send tokens to.

4. Enter the amount you want to send. You can also add a memo to specify what the transaction is for.

5. Verify the recipient address and transaction amount. Remember to always maintain some funds in your wallet in order to be able to carry out further transactions.

6.  Enter your password and click **Submit**.

After a few moments, the tokens will appear in the recipient's wallet.

   :::{admonition} Maintain funds for fees
   :class: warning
   It is recommended to maintain some funds in your wallet to pay for fees. Without available capital for fee payment, you will not be able to carry out further transactions until more tokens are transfered to your wallet.

2. Navigate to the dApp of your choice.

3. To connect your wallet, click **Connect Wallet** at the top of the page.

After connecting your wallet, you will be able to carry out transactions on the dApp.
