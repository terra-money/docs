# Tic-tac-toe app example

This app example was created to illustrate the structure of an application with smart contracts and a basic front end. The open-source application code, including the smart contract code, can be found in the [emidev98/tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/emidev98/tic-tac-toe/tree/main/contracts/tic_tac_toe) repository. 

The [website frontend](https://github.com/emidev98/tic-tac-toe/tree/main/frontend) that allows you to interact with the smart contract is deployed to [tic-tac-toe.decentryfi.xyz](http://tic-tac-toe.decentryfi.xyz/).

## Rules

Two players take turns placing **X**s and **O**s on a 3x3 grid.  The first to align three units in a row wins. For more information on the rules, visit the [Tic-tac-toe Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

## Smart contract architecture

This smart contract is built with 1 query and 4 different executes. To enable a permissionless and trustless game, this contract contains a state machine with the following states:

- `INVITED`: only one game can be in this status at a time per host and opponent pair. This status is achieved by creating a new game. The following possible statuses are PLAYING or REJECTED.
- `PLAYING`: only one game can be in this status at a time per host and opponent pair. This status must mutate from `INVITED`.
- `COMPLETED`: multiple games can be in this status. This status must mutate from `PLAYING`.
- `REJECTED`: multiple games can be in this status. This status must mutate from `INVITE`. 

A host creates the game and invites an opponent to play. This game can only be played by 1 host and 1 opponent at a time. After a match is completed or rejected, a new game can be started.

# QueryMsg

The Games query contains the optional `key` and `status` parameters, which will query the games with the given status. If none of these optional parameters are submitted, the smart contract will return all stored data.


# ExecuteMsg

- 'Invite': create a new game if there is no game in the status 'PLAYING' or 'INVITED'. 
- 'Reject': reject a game in the status 'INVITED' and return the funds to the player who requested to play.
- 'AcceptGame': accept a game in status 'INVITED' only when the sent funds match the game prize. The game will change the status to 'PLAYING'.
- 'Play': continues the match of an existing game in the `PLAYING` status, following the rules of [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). This method also checks the status of the game to validate if a game is finished or not. After a game is finished, the funds will be transferred to the winner or split between the players in the case of a tie.

# Tests

The game only contains unit tests with the KISS approach, so you may see some duplicated code in the testing module. 

The following is the last test coverage achieved with the current version of the module asserting all responses from the smart contract:

```bash
