# CW20 Tokens

According to the [official documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/cw20/0.2.3):

> CW20 is a specification for fungible tokens based on CosmWasm. The name and design is loosely based on Ethereum's ERC20 standard, but many changes have been made. The types in here can be imported by contracts that wish to implement this spec, or by contracts that call to any standard CW20 contract.
