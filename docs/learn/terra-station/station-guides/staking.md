## Redelegate

Redelegating lets you transfer staked Luna from one validator to another without waiting the 21-day unstaking period. Redelegating happens instantly.

:::{warning}
When a user redelegates staked Luna from one validator to another, the validator receiving the staked Luna is barred from making further redelegation transactions for 21 days. This requirement only applies to the wallet that made the redelegation transaction.
:::

1. Open Terra Station and connect your wallet. Click **Staking**.

2. Click on the validator you want to redelegate to.

3. Under the **My delegations** section, click **Redelegate**.

4. Select the validator you would like to redelegate from.

5. Enter the amount of Luna you want to redelegate.

6. Confirm the amounts. Enter your password and click **Redelegate**.

Your staked Luna will be transferred to the new validator.

## Undelegate

Undelegate Luna to unstake it from a validator. The unstaking period takes 21 days to complete.

:::{warning}
Once started, the delegating or undelegating processes can't be stopped.
Undelegating takes 21 days to complete. The only way to undo a delegating or undelegating transaction is to wait for the unbonding process to pass. Alternatively, you can redelegate staked Luna to a different validator without waiting 21 days.
:::

1. Open Terra Station and connect your wallet. Click **Staking**.

2. Click on the validator you want to unstake from.

3. Click **Undelegate** under the **My delegations** section.

4. Enter the amount of Luna you want to undelegate. Click **Next**.

4. Confirm the amounts. Enter your password and click **Undelegate**.

Your staked Luna is unbonding. Please check back in 21 days to complete the process.
