# Terra Station on Chrome

Complete this tutorial to install the Terra Station extension for the Google Chrome browser.

## Prerequisites

- Download and install [Terra Station for desktop](terra-station-desktop.md).
- Download [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## Install the Terra Station extension

1. Open your Chrome browser and visit the [the Terra Station web extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/terra-station/aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp).

2. Install the extension and add it to your browser.

## Create a wallet

Use this tutorial to create a new wallet. To connect to an existing wallet, visit [how to connect to a wallet](../station-guides/wallet.md#connect-to-a-wallet-using-a-private-key).

1. Open the browser extension and click **New wallet**.

2. Type in a secure wallet name and password.

3. Confirm your password.

4. Using a pen and paper, write down your 24-word seed phrase exactly as it appears. Number each word to make verifying easier.

    :::{admonition} Protect your seed phrase
    :class: danger
    Anyone with your seed phrase can access your money, and there is no recourse for someone stealing your seed phrase. To protect your seed phrase, consider the following tips:

    - Never save or store your seed phrase as a digital file on any device.
    - Always write down your seed phrase with a pen and paper.
    - Store the paper with your seed phrase on it somewhere safe.
    - Never give your seed phrase to anyone, not even support staff.
    :::

5. Verify your writing to make sure every word is spelled correctly and in the right order. If you numbered your phrase, it can be helpful to verify it backward.

6. Check the box ensuring you wrote down your seed phrase, and click **Next**.

7. Confirm your seed phrase by typing or selecting the correct words in each prompt.

8. Click **Create a wallet**.

Congratulations! You have just created a Terra Station wallet.

## Receive tokens from an exchange

1. Purchase your tokens using any exchange that supports Terra. To view a list of current exchanges, visit the [Integrations page](../../ecosystem/integrations.md#exchanges)

1. Withdraw any token supported by the Terra network from your exchange. Every exchange is different. Please visit your exchange's web page for guides on how to withdraw tokens. Use the following steps as a generic guide.

    1. To receive tokens to your wallet, use your wallet address. Your wallet address will appear at the top of the Terra station Desktop app near your wallet name. Your wallet address will look like this: `terra<random-numbers-and-letters>`

    1. Double-check your wallet address is correct before sending.

    1. Send the tokens from the exchange to your Terra Station wallet address.

    :::{admonition} Waiting times for transfers
    :class: warning
    When you transfer tokens from an exchange to Terra, some time will pass before the tokens appear in your wallet. Don't panic. This waiting period is normal and varies depending on the exchange. If a transfer does not appear immediately, check back after some time.
    :::

Now you have tokens on Terra!

## Send tokens

1. Open the Terra Station browser extension and connect to your wallet.

2. Click on the token in your available balance that you want to send.

3. Enter the address of the wallet you want to send tokens to.

4. Enter the amount you want to send. You can also add a memo for the transaction.

5. Click **Next**.

6. Verify the transaction amounts and specify which token you want to pay fees in. Remember to always leave enough tokens in your account for other transactions.

7.  Enter your password and click **Send**.

After a few moments, the tokens will appear in the receiver's wallet.

## Connect to a dApp

1. Open the Terra Station browser extension and connect to your wallet.

2. Navigate to the dApp of your choice. We'll use the [Anchor protocol WebApp](https://app.anchorprotocol.com/) for this tutorial. Most dApps use a similar process, though others may vary.

3. To connect your wallet, click **Connect Wallet** at the top of the page.

4. Select **Terra Station (extension)** to connect your wallet.  

5. When prompted, click **Allow**.

You can now make transactions on different dApps in the Terra ecosystem.
