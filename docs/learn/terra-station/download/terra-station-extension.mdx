Anyone who gains access to your seed phrase can access the contents of the corresponding wallet. Be cognizant of the fact that there is no recourse for theft of a seed phrase. To protect your seed phrase, consider the following tips.

- Never save or store your seed phrase as a digital file on any device.
- Always write down your seed phrase with a pen and paper.
- Store the paper with your seed phrase on it somewhere safe.
- Never give your seed phrase to anyone, not even support staff.

3. Withdraw any token supported by the Terra network from your exchange. Every exchange will be different and you should visit the web page of their preferred exchange for details on how to withdraw tokens. Use the following steps as a generic guide.

  1. To receive tokens to your wallet, use your wallet address. Your wallet address will appear at the top of the Terra Station Chrome extension just below your wallet name. Your wallet address will take the following form: `terra<random-numbers-and-letters>`

  2. Double-check that your submitted address matches the address of the wallet where you would like to receive funds.

  3. Send the tokens from the exchange to your Terra Station wallet address.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Transfer wait times">
When you transfer tokens from an exchange to Terra, it will take some time for the tokens to appear in your wallet. Don't panic. This waiting period is normal and varies depending on the exchange used. If a transfer does not appear immediately, check back after some time.
</Admonition>

## Send tokens

1. Open the Terra Station browser extension and connect to your wallet.

2. Click **Send** next to the token you want to send.

6. Verify the recipient address and transaction amount. Remember to always maintain some funds in your wallet for future transactions.

7.  Enter your password and click **Submit**.

After a few moments, the tokens will appear in the recipient's wallet.

## Connect to a dApp

1. Open the Terra Station Chrome extension and connect to your wallet.

2. Navigate to the dApp of your choice.

3. To connect your wallet, click **Connect Wallet** at the top of the page.
