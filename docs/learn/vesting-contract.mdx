# Community pool vesting contract

## Introduction

The community pool vesting contract was created for the implementation of [Terra governance proposal 4790](https://station.money/proposal/phoenix-1/4790). The contract allows funds to be vested based on the parameters outlined in the proposal. The contract will go into effect with the passing of the proposal. The following section describes the technical details of the contract. 

## About the contract

**Source**: https://github.com/terra-money/community-pool-vesting

The community pool vesting contract is designed to manage the delegation, vesting, and withdrawal of funds based on a configurable vesting schedule. It includes functionality for `owner` and `whitelist` management. The `whitelist` is a set of users who are allowed to withdraw unlocked funds directly to the contract's specified `recipient`. This contract allows the `owner` to delegate, undelegate, redelegate, and withdraw staking rewards at *any* time, regardless of whether the funds are vested or unvested. This functionality gives the contract funds the same permissions as [Luna vesting from a genesis allocation](https://docs.terra.money/learn/protocol#vesting). 

The [instantiating parameters](#instantiatemsg) for the [contract](https://terrasco.pe/mainnet/address/terra19yxffalxzu88n5lnj40trehpryemqsz7pnnwxp8v73hxz0rl2u9q5qqwh4) defined in [governance proposal 4790](https://station.money/proposal/phoenix-1/4790) are as follows:

- `owner`: "terra159q4e7zl84hzkwy95kl29accklrxpth4zcuz8m87p4nvykpszrtq5qfgfe" (Main TFL Multisig)
- `recipient`: "terra1yv5fyftazjsy3uslzwrsaqcahn8mht87kf7jzlh50yfnu7mqxymsja06dz" (Liquidity Multisig [initially unlocked funds will be sent here])
- `unlocked_amount`: "25000000000000" (25M LUNA)
- `cliff_amount`: "25000000000000" (25M LUNA)
- `vesting_amount`: "100000000000000" (100M LUNA)
- `start_time`: "1735707600" (Jan 1, 2025, 00\:00\:00 UTC in seconds)
- `end_time`: "1861937999" (Dec 31, 2028, 23\:59\:59 UTC in seconds)

The instantiating parameters outline the following distribution:

- 25M LUNA to be immediately withdrawn to the Liquidity multisig upon the passing of the proposal. 
- 25M LUNA to be locked until fully withdrawable on Jan 1, 2025, at 00\:00\:00 UTC
- 100M LUNA to be linearly vesting from Jan 1, 2025, 00\:00\:00 UTC until Dec 31, 2028, 23\:59\:59 UTC at a rate of 68,446 (+/- 1) LUNA per day. 

### Fund Withdrawal Calculation

The fund withdrawal calculation in this contract is designed to manage the withdrawal of funds based on a vesting schedule. It includes three types of fund withdrawals: unlocked, cliff-vested, and vested. The calculation is as follows:

**Unlocked Funds:**
- `unlocked_funds` can be withdrawn at any time.
- The contract tracks the total withdrawn unlocked amount and the amount already withdrawn to ensure that the unlocked funds can only be withdrawn a single time.

**Cliff-Vested Funds:**
- `cliff_vested` funds can be wholly withdrawn after the vesting start time.
- The contract tracks the total withdrawn `cliff_vested` funds and the amount already withdrawn to ensure that the unlocked funds can only be withdrawn a single time.

**Vested Funds:**
- `vested_funds` are unlocked during the vesting period and can be withdrawn after the vesting start time.
- The contract ensures that unlocked and cliff-vested funds have been withdrawn before allowing vested fund withdrawals.
- Vested funds are calculated based on a linear vesting formula that considers the vesting start and end times. The formula is as follows:
  
  `Vested = Total Vesting Amount * (Current Time - Start Time) / (End Time - Start Time)`

<Admonition type="danger" icon="❗" title="Important">

Delegation, undelegation, redelegation, and staking reward withdrawals are **enabled** in this contract, meaning that the vesting contract gives the `owner` the same permissions as [Luna vesting from genesis](./protocol.mdx#vesting).
