# Wormhole Bridge tutorial

Wormhole's Portal Bridge allows you to bridge tokens across different chains. Instead of swapping or converting assets directly, Wormhole locks your source assets in a smart contract and mints new Wormhole-wrapped assets on the target chain. You can then swap Wormhole-wrapped assets on an exchange for other assets on the target chain.

Use this tutorial to bridge your assets between Terra and other chains using Wormhole.

## Prerequisites

- [The Station browser extension](download/station-extension.mdx) for tokens on the Terra blockchain.
- A wallet on the chain you want to bridge.

Be sure to have enough tokens in your wallets to pay for fees. Remember that fees will be charged for sending and redeeming tokens.
