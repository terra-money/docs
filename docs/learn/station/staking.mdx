<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️" title="Maintain funds for transaction fees">

It is recommended to maintain some funds in your wallet for future transactions. Without available capital for fee payment, you will not be able to carry out further transactions until more tokens are transferred to your wallet.

5. Double-check the amounts and fees, enter your password, and click **Submit**.

Congratulations, you've just delegated Luna!

## Quick staking

Quick staking chooses validators on your behalf for easy staking. To promote decentralization, quick staking randomly selects validators that meet the following criteria:

- Bottom 65% of the validator set by voting power
- No slashes in the last 1,200,000 blocks
- Commission of 5% or less

<Admonition type="info" icon="💡" title="Quick stake distribution">

- Delegations of 100 or less will be delegated to 1 validator.
- Delegations of 1000 or less will be split among 2 validators.
- Delegations of 10,000 or less will be split among 4 validators.
- Delegations of 10,000 or more will be split among 5 validators.

</Admonition>

1. To quick stake, open Station and select **Stake**. On the Stake page, select **Quick Stake**.

2. Double-check the amounts and fees, enter your password, and click **Submit**

The quick undelegation function considers your current delegations and undelegates from the validators with the highest voting power until your desired token amount is met.

## Staking other native assets

You can stake tokens on other networks supported by Station by selecting a different chain on the staking page. Once you've selected your desired chain, follow the steps above.

## Withdraw staking rewards

Rewards start accruing the moment you stake. Monitor your rewards in the staking section of Station. Once you have sufficient rewards, follow the steps below to withdraw them.

1. Open Station and click **Stake**.

2. To claim all rewards, click **Withdraw all rewards** in the upper right corner of the staking page. To withdraw rewards from a single validator, click on **Manual stake**, select their name in the Validators list, and click **Withdraw rewards** on the Validator details page.

<img className="readme-img-md" src="/img/screens/desktop/stake-page.png" />

3. Review the amount, enter your password, and click **Submit**.

Congratulations, you've just withdrawn your staking rewards!

## Redelegate

Redelegating lets you transfer staked tokens from one validator to another instantly, without having to wait for the unstaking period.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️">

When a user redelegates tokens from one validator to another, the validator receiving the staked tokens is barred from making further redelegation transactions for the staking period (1-3 weeks). This restriction only applies to the wallet that made the redelegation transaction.

</Admonition>

1. Open Station, connect your wallet, and click on **Stake**.

2. Select the validator you would like to redelegate to.

3. In the **My delegations** section, click **Redelegate**.

4. Select the validator you would like to redelegate from.

5. Enter the token amount you want to redelegate.

6. Confirm the transaction details, enter your password, and click **Submit**.

Your staked tokens will be transferred to the new validator.

## Undelegate

To unstake your tokens, you will need to undelegate from the validator to which the funds were originally staked. After undelegating, it will take 7-21 days — depending on the chain — for the undelegated funds to be available in your wallet.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️" title="Undelegation waiting period">

After funds are undelegated, they will be locked for a period of 7-21 days. Once this process has started, there is no option for reversal. After this period has concluded, the funds will be transferred to your wallet where they will once again be available to carry out transactions with. If you would like to simply stake with another validator, you may use the redelegating process which occurs immediately without the need to wait for processing.

</Admonition>

1. Open Station, connect your wallet, and click **Stake** in the sidebar.

2. Click on the **Manual Stake** tab.

3. Select the chain and the validator you want to unstake from.

4. In the **My delegations** section, click **Undelegate**.

5. Enter the amount you want to undelegate.

6. Confirm the transaction details, enter your password, and click **Submit**.

After submitting the transaction, you will have to wait 1-3 weeks — depending on the chain — for the staked funds to be unlocked. Then submit another transaction to claim your unstaked tokens.
