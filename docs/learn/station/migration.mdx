# Migrate to Interchain Station

Use this guide to import an existing wallet into Station.

## Prerequisites

- Download [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
- Download the [Station Chrome extension](download/station-extension.mdx) and [create a wallet](download/station-extension.mdx#create-a-wallet).
- Make sure you have access to your seed phrase.

## Import an existing Station wallet

To access other chains on Station you need to re-add your wallet.

If you do not re-add your wallet, you will still have access to the private key and funds associated with your wallet, but you will not be able to interact with newly supported chains.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="ℹ️">

Station needs to derive your wallet address for each chain from the same mnemonic seed phrase. Station must re-load your mnemonic seed phrase in order to detect tokens held in wallets that were created via the `118` derivation path. For more info on mnemonic seed phrases, visit the [Keys page](../../../docs/develop/feather-js/keys.mdx#mnemonickey).

1. Open the Station extension.
   - If this is your first time using Station, continue to step 2.
   - If you are already signed in to another wallet, click on your wallet name and then click **Add a wallet**.
