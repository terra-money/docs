## Receive tokens from an exchange

1. Purchase your tokens using an exchange that supports Terra.

2. Withdraw any token supported by the Terra network from your exchange. Every exchange will be different and you should visit the web page of their preferred exchange for details on how to withdraw tokens. Use the following steps as a generic guide.

   1. To receive tokens to your wallet, use your wallet address. To copy your wallet address, just click on the name of your wallet in the upper right-hand corner of the app and click on **COPY** just below the address. Your wallet address will take the following form: `terra<random-numbers-and-letters>`

   2. Double-check that your submitted address matches the address of the wallet where you would like to receive funds.

   3. Send the tokens from the exchange to your Station wallet address.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️" title="Transfer wait times">

When you transfer tokens from an exchange to Terra, it will take some time for the tokens to appear in your wallet. Don't panic. This waiting period is normal and varies depending on the exchange used. If a transfer does not appear immediately, check back after some time.
