# Multisig wallets

Multisig wallets are an advanced feature of Station. If you’re using Station for the first time, follow the [Station tutorial](download/station-desktop.mdx).

Multisig wallets enable a wallet to be controlled by multiple parties. A wallet manager creates a transaction and sends an encoded transaction message to the wallet signers. The signers sign the transaction and send back their signatures. The wallet manager then inputs the encoded transaction message along with the received signatures to complete the transaction.

## Prerequisites

- Download the [Station browser extension](download/station-extension.mdx)

## Create a multisig wallet

1. Open the Station browser extension, click on **Add a wallet**, and then click **New multisig wallet**.

2. Enter the wallet addresses of each user of the multisig wallet.

3. In the **Threshold** field, enter the number of signatures needed to post a transaction .

You will need to record the order of the wallet addresses provided as well as the threshold value for initial transaction confirmation. Each wallet address provided must have a transaction history of at least one transaction before it can be added as a signer of a multisig wallet.

Brand new multisig wallets have no transaction history. After your first transaction, you will be prompted to provide the wallet addresses and the threshold value specified when first creating the multisig wallet. After you provide this information, you may proceed with your transaction.

3. After submitting your transaction, you will be taken to the **Post a multisig tx** page.

4. Copy and send the multisig wallet address as well as the encoded message in the **Tx** box to each of the multisig wallet signers.

Encoded multisig transaction messages simply consist of a description of the transaction and do not contain any sensitive information. Therefore, these messages may be sent utilizing your preferred messenger application.
