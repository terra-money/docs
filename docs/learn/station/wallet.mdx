Anyone who gains access to your seed phrase can access the contents of the corresponding wallet. Be cognizant of the fact that there is no recourse for theft of a seed phrase. To protect your seed phrase, consider the following tips.

- Never save or store your seed phrase as a digital file on any device.
- Always write down your seed phrase with a pen and paper.
- Store the paper with your seed phrase on it somewhere safe.
- Never give your seed phrase to anyone, not even support staff.

You can access the wallet again by entering your [seed phrase](#recover-a-wallet-using-a-seed-phrase) or [private key and password](#connect-to-a-wallet-using-a-private-key). Deleting a wallet from one device does not delete it from other devices.

<Admonition type="danger" icon="🔥" title="Write down your seed phrase">

Before you delete your wallet, always make sure you have your seed phrase and private key. Never store your seed phrase on a digital device. Without a seed phrase or private key and password, your wallet and funds will be permanently inaccessible. Always store your seed phrase in a secure location.
