## Create a wallet

1. Open the Terra Station desktop app and click **New wallet**.

3. Confirm your password.

4. Using a pen and paper, write down your 24-word seed phrase exactly as it appears. Number each word to make verifying easier.

:::danger Protect your seed phrase
Anyone with your seed phrase can access your money, and there is no recourse for someone stealing your seed phrase. To protect your seed phrase, consider the following tips:

- Never save or store your seed phrase as a digital file on any device.
- Always write down your seed phrase with a pen and paper.
- Store the paper with your seed phrase on it somewhere safe.
- Never give your seed phrase to anyone, not even support staff.
:::

5. Verify your writing to make sure every word is spelled correctly and in the right order. If you numbered your phrase, it can be helpful to verify it backward.

5. Check the box ensuring you wrote down your seed phrase, and click **Next**.

6. Confirm your seed phrase by typing or selecting the correct words in each prompt.

7. Click **Create a wallet**.

Congratulations! You have just created a Terra Station wallet.

## Receive tokens from an exchange

1. Purchase your tokens using any exchange that supports Terra. To view a list of current exchanges, visit the [Integrations page](https://docs.terra.money/Reference/integrations.html#exchanges)

1. Withdraw any token supported by the Terra network from your exchange. Every exchange is different. Please visit your exchange's web page for guides on how to withdraw tokens. Use the following steps as a generic guide.

    1. To receive tokens to your wallet, use your wallet address. Your wallet address will appear at the top of the Terra station Desktop app near your wallet name. Your wallet address will look like this: `terra1hm4grlwkt26tccr4vclwjz3elgh224wquctwye`

    1. Double-check your wallet address is correct before sending.

    1. Send the tokens from the exchange to your Terra Station wallet address.

:::warning Waiting times for transfers
When you transfer tokens from an exchange to Terra, some time will pass before the tokens appear in your wallet. Don't panic. This waiting period is normal and varies depending on the exchange. If a transfer does not appear immediately, check back after some time.
:::

Now you have tokens on Terra!

## Swap coins

1. Open Terra Station and connect your wallet. Click **Swap** in the sidebar.

2. Navigate to the **Swap coins** section. On the left side, select a coin and input the amount you want to swap.

4. Click **Next**. A new window will appear.

5. Confirm your transaction amounts and input your password.

6. Click **Swap** to complete your transaction.

## Stake Luna

Stake your Luna to a validator to start earning rewards. Before you stake, make sure you have Luna in your wallet. You can transfer Luna from an [exchange](#receive-tokens-from-an-exchange) or [swap coins](#swap-coins) you have for Luna.

1. Open Terra Station and click **Staking**.

2. Select a Validator and click on their name in the **Moniker** column of the validator list.

3. In the **My delegations** section, click **Delegate**. A new window will appear.

4. In the **Amount** field, specify the amount of Luna you want to delegate, and click **Next**.

::: warning Keep coins for fees
Always keep some coins to pay fees with. Never stake your entire wallet amount. Without money for fees, you can't make any transactions.
:::

5. Double check the amounts and fees. Enter your password and click **Delegate**.

Congratulations, you've just delegated Luna!

## Withdraw staking rewards

Rewards start accruing the moment you stake Luna. Monitor your rewards in the staking section of Terra Station. Once you have sufficient rewards, follow these steps to withdraw them:

1. Open Terra Station and click **Staking**.

2. To claim all rewards, click **Withdraw all rewards** in the upper right corner of the staking page. To withdraw rewards only from a single validator, click on their name in the list and click **withdraw** on their page.  A new window will appear.

2. Review the amounts and specify which coin you want to pay fees in.

3. Enter your password and click **withdraw**.

Congratulations, you've just withdrawn your staking rewards!

2. Click **Wallet** in the navigation bar.

3. Click **Send** next to the token you want to send.
