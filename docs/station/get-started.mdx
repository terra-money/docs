# Get started

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to download the Station extension and import or create a new wallet. If you were using a previous version of Station, follow the [Upgrade guide](./upgrade.mdx) to upgrade your wallets to the latest version. 

## Download Station

Download Station by following the steps below or by visiting [https://setup.station.money/](https://setup.station.money/). 

1. [Download Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) or open your existing Chrome browser and visit the [Station page in the Chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp). 

2. Click **Add to Chrome** and follow the directions in your browser. It's a good idea to [pin Station](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/11190170?hl=en&sjid=14540060193646765368-NA) in the Extension toolbar so it stays accessible. 

## Create a new wallet

If this is your first time using Station, you'll need to create a new wallet. 

1. Open the Station extension in your browser, and then click **Create new wallet**.

    alt="Create"
/>

2. Enter a name for your new wallet. 

<img
    className="readme-img-md"
    src="/img/screens/create/create-2.png"
    alt="Create"
/>

3. Using a pen and paper, write down your 24-word recovery phrase exactly as it appears. Number each word to make verifying easier.

<Admonition type="danger" icon="🔥" title="Protect your recovery phrase">
Anyone who gains access to your seed phrase can access the contents of your wallet. There is no recourse for a stolen recovery phrase. To protect your seed phrase, consider the following tips.

- Never save or store your seed phrase as a digital file on any device.
- Always write down your seed phrase with a pen and paper.
- Store the paper with your seed phrase on it somewhere safe where only you can access it. 
- Never give your seed phrase to anyone, not even support staff.

4. Verify the written seed phrase to ensure every word is spelled correctly and that each word is in the correct order. Verifying the words in reverse order may help. 

5. Check the box to confirm that your seed phrase has been written down and click **Create Wallet**. Keep your seed phrase around for the next step. 

6. Confirm your seed phrase by selecting the correct words in each prompt and then click **Confirm**.
