# Terra

Terra is a blockchain protocol that supports stable programmable payments and open financial infrastructure development. It is supported by a basket of fiat-pegged, seigniorage share style stablecoins which are algorithmically stabilized by its native cryptoasset, Luna.

One part of Terra's value contributions, payments, in essence replaces the complicated payments value chain, including credit card networks, banks, and payment gateways with a single blockchain layer. In concert with the efficiencies that Terra has provided payment channels for both merchants and consumers, it continues to steadily provide infrastructural improvements and tools for the foundations of laying down a credibly neutral, distributed, and radically transparent ecosystem. 

Bolstered through the initial mass adoption of Terra's blockchain infrastructure powering its partner, CHAI, which has amassed over 1.3 million users to date, Terra moves naturally towards ecosystem building that offers competitive programmable payments, logistics, and infrastructure to power the plethora of industry that will be built on efficiency and scale.
