# Run a full Terra node

## Hardware requirements

Running a full Terra node is a resource-intensive process that requires a persistent server. If you want to use Terra without downloading the entire blockchain, use [Terra Station](https://station.terra.money/).

We recommend the following hardware to run a full node:

- Four or more CPU cores
- At least 2 TB of disk storage
- At least 32 GB of memory
- At least 300 mbps of network bandwidth
