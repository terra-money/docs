`terrad` is the command-line interface and daemon that connects to Terra and enables you to interact with the Terra blockchain. Terra core is the official Golang reference implementation of the Terra node software.

This guide is for developers who want to install `terrad` and interact with Terra core without running a full node. If you want to run a full node or join a network, visit [](../../../full-node/run-a-full-terra-node/README.md).
