# Integrations

You can integrate LocalTerra in Terra Station, Terrad, and JavaScript and Python SDKs.

## Terra Station

Terra Station has built-in support for LocalTerra for quick and easy interaction. [Open Terra Station](https://station.terra.money/) and switch to the `Localterra` network.

## Terrad

1. Ensure the latest versions of Terrad and LocalTerra are installed.

2. Use Terrad to talk to your LocalTerra Terrad node:

   ```sh
   $ terrad status
   ```

   Terrad will connect to `localhost:26657` by default when running this command.

   The following command is the explicit form:

   ```sh
   $ terrad status --node=tcp://localhost:26657
   ```

3. Run any Terrad commands against your LocalTerra network:

   ```sh
   $ terrad query account terra1dcegyrekltswvyy0xy69ydgxn9x8x32zdtapd8
   ```

## Terra Python SDK

Connect to the chain through LocalTerra's LCD server using terra.py:

```python
from terra_sdk.client.lcd import LCDClient
terra = LCDClient("localterra", "http://localhost:1317")
```

## Terra JavaScript SDK

Connect to the chain through LocalTerra's LCD server using feather.js:

```ts
import { LCDClient } from '@terra-money/feather.js';

const terra = new LCDClient({
  URL: 'http://localhost:1317',
  chainID: 'localterra',
});
```
