# LocalTerra

LocalTerra is a complete Terra testnet and ecosystem containerized with Docker and orchestrated with a simple `docker-compose` file. It allows smart contract developers to be able to test their contracts in a sandbox before they deploy them on a testnet or mainnet.

LocalTerra comes preconfigured with pragmatic defaults for standard testing environments. If other projects mention testing on LocalTerra, they are referring to the settings defined in this guide.

LocalTerra has the following advantages over a public testnet:

- Easily modifiable world states.
- Quick to reset for rapid iterations.
- Simple simulations of different scenarios.
- Controllable validator behaviour.
