# Configure LocalTerra

The majority of LocalTerra is implemented inside of the `docker-compose.yml` file, making it easily customizable. You can use LocalTerra as a starting point for setting up your own local Terra testnet with Docker containers.

Out of the box, LocalTerra comes with several preconfigured settings such as:

- Ports defined for RPC (26657), LCD (1317), and FCD (3060).
- Standard [accounts](accounts.mdx).

## Modify node configuration

You can modify the node configuration of your validator in the `config/config.toml` and `config/app.toml` files.

## Speed up block time

LocalTerra is often used alongside [feather.js](../feather-js/README.mdx) or [Terra.py](../terra-py/get-started-py.mdx) scripting as it is a convenient environment in which to run integration tests. LocalTerra also allows developers to speed up the block time to improve the development experience.

To increase block time, edit the `[consensus]` parameters in the `config/config.toml` file.

The following example configures all timeouts to `200ms`.

```diff
##### consensus configuration options #####
[consensus]

wal_file = "data/cs.wal/wal"
- timeout_propose = "3s"
- timeout_propose_delta = "500ms"
- timeout_prevote = "1s"
- timeout_prevote_delta = "500ms"
- timeout_precommit_delta = "500ms"
- timeout_commit = "5s"
+ timeout_propose = "200ms"
+ timeout_propose_delta = "200ms"
+ timeout_prevote = "200ms"
+ timeout_prevote_delta = "200ms"
+ timeout_precommit_delta = "200ms"
+ timeout_commit = "200ms"
```

Additionally, you can utilize the following command to achieve the same result.

```sh
sed -E -i '/timeout_(propose|prevote|precommit|commit)/s/[0-9]+m?s/200ms/' config/config.toml
```

## Modifying genesis

You can modify the `genesis.json` file by altering `config/genesis.json`. Make sure to restart LocalTerra for your changes to be implemented.
