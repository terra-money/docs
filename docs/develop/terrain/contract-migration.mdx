# Migrating CosmWasm contracts on Terra

Contracts on Terra can be initialized as [migratable](../module-specifications/spec-wasm.mdx#migration), which allows the administrator to upload a new version of the contract and then send a migrate message to move to the new code.

This tutorial uses [Terrain](./README.mdx), a Terra development suite designed to simplify the scaffolding, deployment, and migration of your contracts. 

If this is your first time using Terrain, visit the [Initial setup guide](./initial-setup.mdx). 

## Overview

There are two key components to a migratable contract: 

- A `MigrateMsg` transaction. 
- An admin set, which is the address that's allowed to perform migrations. 

## 1. Add `MigrateMsg` to contract

To implement support for `MigrateMsg`, add the following to `msg.rs`: 

   ```rust
   #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
   pub struct MigrateMsg {}
   ```

<Admonition type="tip">

You can place this message anywhere, however; it is usually placed above the `InstantiateMsg` struct.

## 2. Update `contract.rs`

Now that `MigrateMsg` is defined, you will need to update `contract.rs`:

1. Update the import from `crate::msg` to include `MigrateMsg`:

   ```
   use crate::msg::{CountResponse, ExecuteMsg, InstantiateMsg, QueryMsg, MigrateMsg};
   ```

2. Add the following method above `instantiate`: 

   ```
   #[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
   pub fn migrate(_deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, _msg: MigrateMsg) -> StdResult<Response> {
       Ok(Response::default())
   }
   ```

## 3. Call migrate

In previous [Terrain tutorials](./README.mdx), you learned how to deploy the contract. Now you will be able to initialize it as migratable. 

After adding MigrateMsg to the smart contract, redeploy and add the `--set-signer-as-admin` flag. 
This flag tells Terra that the transaction signer is allowed to migrate the contract in the future:


   ```
   terrain deploy counter --signer test1 --set-signer-as-admin
   ```

With the new contract deployed you can make some changes then migrate to the new code with the following command: 

   ```
   terrain contract:migrate counter --signer test1
   ```
