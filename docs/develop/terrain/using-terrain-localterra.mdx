# Use Terrain with LocalTerra

LocalTerra is a complete Terra testnet and ecosystem containerized with Docker. Use LocalTerra to simulate transactions in a test environment.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)
- At least 16 GB of RAM
- [Terra Station Chrome extension](../../learn/terra-station/download/terra-station-extension.mdx)
- Node.js version 16

<Admonition type="caution" title="Node version error">

Use LTS Node.js 16 if you encounter the following error code:  
`error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported`

</Admonition>

<p>

Some M1 macs may need to use the latest LTS version of Node to complete this tutorial. Consider using a node version manager such as [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.mdx).
After installing NVM, run the following to install and use the latest LTS version of node:

```sh
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

The `nvm use --lts` command will need to be run every time you open a new terminal to use the LTS version of node.

To default to the LTS version of node when restarting your terminal, run the following:

```sh
nvm alias default <INSERT NODE VERSION HERE>
```

## Install and run LocalTerra

1. To download LocalTerra, run the following commands:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/terra-money/localterra
```

2. Start LocalTerra by running the following:

```sh
cd localterra
docker-compose up
```

3. You will start seeing LocalTerra block activity in your terminal. Keep LocalTerra running while you perform the next steps in a new terminal window.

# Counter tutorial

After installing LocalTerra, you are ready to use Terrain. This short tutorial walks you through setting up your project and creating a simple counter that increments upon request.

## 1. Scaffold your dApp

With Terrain installed you can now scaffold your new application in a new terminal window:

1. Create a new folder for your dApp:

```sh
terrain new my_terra_dapp
```

2. Scaffold your dApp:

```sh
cd my_terra_dapp
npm install
```

### Project structure

The following structure shows your scaffolded project:

```
.
├── contracts              # The contracts' source code.
│   ├── my_terra_dapp
│   └── ...                # Add more contracts here.
├── frontend               # The front-end application.
├── lib                    # Predefined functions for task and console.
├── tasks                  # Predefined tasks.
├── keys.terrain.js        # Keys for signing transactions.
├── config.terrain.json    # Config for connections and contract deployments.
└── refs.terrain.json      # Deployed code and contract references.
```

## 2. Deploy

To deploy the application, run the following command:

```sh
terrain deploy my_terra_dapp
```

The deploy command performs the following steps automatically:

- Builds the counter smart contract.
- Optimizes the counter smart contract.
- Uploads counter smart contract to LocalTerra.
- Instantiates the deployed smart contract.

<Admonition type="note" title="Increase Docker memory">

If you are running LocalTerra and the previous `deploy` command is not working, try increasing Docker's memory allowance by clicking on the Docker icon. Click **Preferences** and then **Resources**. Increase the memory to at least 4 gigs. Click **Apply & Restart**. Run the deploy command again. You can increase again to 6 gigs if you are still having trouble.

## 3. Generate TypeScript client

Terrain 0.5.x and above includes the ability to automatically generate a TypeScript client based on your smart contract schema.

Generating a client is easy, just run the following command:

```
terrain contract:generateClient my_terra_dapp --build-schema
```

The generated client will be put in `./lib/clients` and copied to the frontend.

## 4. Interact with the deployed contract

The template comes with several predefined helpers in `lib/index.ts`. Use them to start interacting with your smart contract:

1. Run the following:

```sh
terrain console
```

2. With the console open, increment the counter by running the following:

```JavaScript
await lib.increment()
```

3. You can get the current count by using:

```JavaScript
await lib.getCount()
```

4. After incrementing once, `await lib.getCount()` will return:

```json
{ "count": 1 }
```

<Admonition type="tip">

Before proceeding to the next section, kill the running command in your terminal by entering "Ctrl + C" .

</Admonition>

## 5. Front-end scaffolding

Terrain also scaffolds a very simple front-end:

1. Open the [Terra Station Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/terra-station-wallet/aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp), click the gear icon, and switch the network to Localterra.

2. To use the front end, run the following commands in order.

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

3. Open the Terra Station extension and click **Add a wallet**. Click **Recover wallet** and input the following seed phrase to access the sole validator on the LocalTerra network and gain funds to get started with smart contracts:

```
satisfy adjust timber high purchase tuition stool faith fine install that you unaware feed domain license impose boss human eager hat rent enjoy dawn
```

4. With LocalTerra selected in Terra Station and the local seed phrase imported, you can now increment and reset the counter from the front end.
