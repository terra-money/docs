# Get started

Use this beginner-friendly guide to start building on Terra.

<Admonition type="tip" icon="💡" title="Learn about Terra">

To learn more about Terra concepts such as Luna, validators, and governance, visit the [Terra protocol overview](../learn/protocol.mdx).

</Admonition>

Follow the steps below to get started with Terrain and build your own dApp!

### 1. Set up Terrain <ThemedImage sources={{light:"/img/icons/terrain.svg", dark:"/img/icons/dark/terrain.svg"}} height="30px" />

Terrain is a user-friendly development environment for developing smart contracts. Terrain makes it easy to create smart contract templates, deploy them to the Terra blockchain, and connect them to a frontend app.

Follow the [Terrain setup tutorial](./terrain/initial-setup.mdx) to get started using Terrain.

### 2. Download LocalTerra and start building <ThemedImage sources={{light:"/img/icons/localterra.svg", dark:"/img/icons/dark/localterra.svg"}} height="30px" />

LocalTerra is a scaled-down Terra blockchain that allows you to test your dApp locally. LocalTerra provides a single validator node and [10 preconfigured wallet accounts](./localterra/accounts.mdx).

Follow the [Terrain with LocalTerra tutorial](./terrain/using-terrain-localterra.mdx) to start using Terrain and create a simple counter app.

### 3. Mint an NFT <ThemedImage sources={{light:"/img/icons/mintnft.svg", dark:"/img/icons/dark/mintnft.svg"}} height="30px" />

Now that you are familiar with Terrain and LocalTerra, you can try minting an NFT with Terrain.

The [NFT minting](./terrain/mint-an-nft.mdx) tutorial walks you through the creation of an NFT minting application using the dApp scaffolding and front end provided by Terrain.

## Development Suite

Congrats! You have the basics down!

Now you can dive into the other tools in the Terra Development Suite. Visit the [tool guide](which-tools.mdx) for more info.

### Feather.js <ThemedImage sources={{light:"/img/icons/feather-js.svg", dark:"/img/icons/dark/feather-js.svg"}} height="30px" />

Use feather.js to create bots, power NFT mints, and for all-purpose back end services. Follow the [feather.js tutorial](./feather-js/getting-started.mdx) to get started.

### Terra.py <ThemedImage sources={{light:"/img/icons/terra-py.svg", dark:"/img/icons/dark/terra-py.svg"}} height="30px" />

Use Terra.py for on-chain analytics, Jupyter Notebooks, data processing, and other mathematical processes. Follow the [Terra.py](https://terra-money.github.io/terra.py/tutorial.html) tutorial to get started.

### Wallet Provider and Templates <ThemedImage sources={{light:"/img/icons/walletconnect02.svg", dark:"/img/icons/dark/walletconnect02.svg"}} height="30px" />

If you have a back end for your app and want a front end to connect to Station, use Wallet provider and Terra Templates. Follow the [Wallet Provider tutorial](wallet-provider/wallet-provider-tutorial.mdx) to get started.

### Other Tools

Terra also provides other tools for building:

- [Finder <ThemedImage sources={{light:"/img/icons/finder.svg", dark:"/img/icons/dark/finder.svg"}} height="20px" />](https://finder.terra.money) : Terra’s multi-purpose block explorer.
- [Faucet <ThemedImage sources={{light:"/img/icons/Faucet.svg", dark:"/img/icons/dark/Faucet.svg"}} height="20px" />](https://faucet.terra.money) : Get tokens sent to your testnet address.
- [Terrad <ThemedImage sources={{light:"/img/icons/Terrad.svg", dark:"/img/icons/dark/Terrad.svg"}} height="20px" />](terrad/install-terrad.mdx) : the node daemon and command line interface that connects to the Terra network.
