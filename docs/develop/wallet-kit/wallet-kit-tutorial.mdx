# Get Started with Wallet Kit

<Admonition type="tip" icon="💡" title="Node version 16">
Wallet Kit does not support mobile. For mobile, use[ Wallet Provider](../wallet-provider/wallet-provider-tutorial.mdx). Mobile support will be coming soon.

[Wallet Kit](https://github.com/terra-money/wallet-kit) makes it easy to build Station (browser extension and mobile) functionality into your React application. It contains custom hooks that drastically simplify common tasks like connecting a wallet and triggering transactions.

This guide will cover how to set up a React app, integrate Wallet Kit, check the balance of the connected account, and call a token swap. If you want to integrate Station into an existing React app, jump to the [Wrap your app in `WalletProvider` section](#2-wrap-your-app-in-walletprovider).

## Prerequisites

- [Station Chrome extension](../../learn/station/download/station-extension.mdx)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Node.js version 16

## 1. Project Setup

1. To get started, you'll need some basic React scaffolding. To generate this, run the following in your terminal:

   ```sh
   npx create-react-app my-terra-app
   cd my-terra-app
   ```

2. Then, install the `@terra-money/wallet-kit` package:

   ```sh
   npm install @terra-money/wallet-kit
   ```

## 2. Wrap your app in `WalletProvider`

Next, you'll wrap your `App` with `<WalletProvider>` to give all your components access to useful data, hooks, and utilities. You'll also need to pass in information about Terra networks, such as the `mainnet` or `chainId`, into the provider via `getInitialConfig`.

1. Navigate to your `Index.js` in a code editor and replace the code with the following:

   ```js
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   import './index.css';
   import App from './App';
   import { getInitialConfig, WalletProvider } from '@terra-money/wallet-kit';

   getInitialConfig().then((defaultNetworks) => {
     ReactDOM.render(
       <WalletProvider defaultNetworks={defaultNetworks}>
         <App />
       </WalletProvider>,
       document.getElementById('root'),
     );
   });
   ```

2. Start the application to make sure it works:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

Your browser should open to `http://localhost:3000/` and you should see the react logo with a black background and some text.

<summary> Getting `polyfill` errors? </summary>
<p>

To solve these errors, can downgrade `react-scripts`: `4.0.3` in your `package.json` and reinstall your dependencies as a quick fix:

1.  Navigate to `my-terra-app` in your terminal and run the following:

    ```sh
    npm install react-scripts@4.0.3 // its important to specify the version
    ```

2.  Reinstall your dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  Restart your app:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

3.  Create a new directory called `components` in the `source` directory. This directory will house components to trigger different actions from our connected wallet.

## 3. Put `useWallet` to work

Now that `App.js` has inherited the context of `WalletProvider`, you can start putting your imports to work. You'll use the multi-purpose `useWallet` and `useConnectedWallet` hooks to connect your Station extension to your web browser.

1. Create a new component file called `Connect.js`.

2. Populate the `Connect.js` file with the following:

```ts
import React from 'react';
import { useConnectedWallet, useWallet } from '@terra-money/wallet-kit';

function Connect() {
  const connectedWallet = useConnectedWallet();
  const { connect, disconnect, availableWallets } = useWallet();

  return (
    <section>
      <h4>Connect info:</h4>
      {connectedWallet ? (
        <>
          <button onClick={() => disconnect()}>Disconnect</button>
          <code>
            <pre>{JSON.stringify(connectedWallet, null, 2)}</pre>
          </code>
        </>
      ) : (
        availableWallets.map(({ id, name, isInstalled }) => (
          <button onClick={() => connect(id)} disabled={!isInstalled} key={id}>
            Connect {name}
          </button>
        ))
      )}
    </section>
  );
}

export default Connect;
```

3. Open `App.js` in your code editor and replace the code with the following:

```ts
import './App.css';
import Connect from './components/Connect';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <Connect />
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

4. Refresh your browser. There should be some new text and buttons in your browser.

5. Make sure your Station extension is connected to a wallet. Click **Connect EXTENSION** and the app will connect to your wallet.

The `status`, `network`, and `wallets` properties in your browser provide useful information about the state of the Terra wallet. Before connecting, the `status` variable will be `WALLET_NOT_CONNECTED` and upon connection, the status becomes `WALLET_CONNECTED`. In addition, the `wallets` array now has one entry with the `connectType` and `terraAddress` you used to connect.

You should be able to see these changes in real-time.

## 4. Querying a wallet balance

It's common for an app to show the connected user's LUNA balance. To achieve this you'll need two hooks. The first is `useLcdClient`. An `LCDClient` is essentially a REST-based adapter for the Terra blockchain. You can use it to query an account balance. The second is `useConnectedWallet`, which tells you if a wallet is connected and, if so, basic information about that wallet such as its address.

Be aware that you will not see any tokens if your wallet is empty.

1. Create a file in your `Components` folder named `Query.js`.

2. Populate `Query.js` with the following:

   ```ts
   import { useConnectedWallet, useLcdClient } from '@terra-money/wallet-kit';
   import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

   export default function Query() {
     const lcd = useLcdClient(); // LCD stands for Light Client Daemon
     const connected = useConnectedWallet();
     const [balance, setBalance] = useState('');
     const chainID = 'phoenix-1'; // or any other mainnet or testnet chainID supported by station (e.g. osmosis-1)

     useEffect(() => {
       if (connected) {
         lcd.bank.balance(connected.addresses[chainID]).then(([coins]) => {
           setBalance(coins.toString());
         });
       } else {
         setBalance(null);
       }
     }, [connected, lcd]); // useEffect is called when these variables change

     return (
       <div>
         {balance && <p>{balance}</p>}
         {!connected && <p>Wallet not connected!</p>}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

3. Open `App.js` in your code editor and add `import Query from './components/Query'` to line 3, and ` <Query />` to line 10. The whole file should look like the following:

   ```js
   import './App.css';
   import Connect from './components/Connect';
   import Query from './components/Query';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div className="App">
         <header className="App-header">
           <Connect />
           <Query />
         </header>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

4. Refresh your browser. Your wallet balance will appear in micro-denominations. Multiply by $10^6$ for an accurate balance.

## 5. Sending a transaction

You can also create and send transactions to the Terra network while using Wallet Kit. You can use [Feather.js](../feather-js/README.mdx) to generate a sample transaction:

```sh
npm install @terra-money/feather.js
```

Before broadcasting this example transaction, ensure you're on the Terra testnet. To change networks, click the gear icon in your Station extension, click on **Networks**, then select **Testnets**.

You can request testnet funds from the [Terra Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.terra.money/).

To transfer LUNA, you will need to supply a message containing the sender address, recipient address, and send amount (in this case 1 LUNA), as well as fee parameters. Once the message is constructed, the `post` method on `connectedWallet` broadcasts it to the network.

<Admonition type="note" icon="📝" title="What happens if something goes wrong?">

Wallet Provider supplies useful error types. This example will handle the `UserDenied` error case, but you can find other cases for error handling [on GitHub](https://github.com/terra-money/wallet-provider/blob/4e601c2dece7bec92c9ce95991d2314220a2c954/packages/src/%40terra-money/wallet-controller/exception/mapExtensionTxError.ts#L23).

</Admonition>

1. Create a file in your `Components` folder named `Tx.js`.

2. Populate `Tx.js` with the following. To make this example interchain retreive the `baseAsset` from the network object.

   ```js
   import { MsgSend } from '@terra-money/feather.js';
   import { useConnectedWallet, useWallet } from '@terra-money/wallet-kit';
   import React, { useCallback, useState } from 'react';

   const TEST_TO_ADDRESS = 'terra12hnhh5vtyg5juqnzm43970nh4fw42pt27nw9g9';

   function Tx() {
     const [txResult, setTxResult] = useState(null);
     const [txError, setTxError] = useState('');

     const connectedWallet = useConnectedWallet();
     const wallet = useWallet();
     const chainID = 'phoenix-1';

     const testTx = useCallback(async () => {
       if (!connectedWallet) {
         return;
       }

       if (connectedWallet.network === 'mainnet') {
         alert(`Please only execute this example on Testnet`);
         return;
       }

       try {
         const transactionMsg = {
           chainID,
           msgs: [
             new MsgSend(connectedWallet.addresses[chainID], TEST_TO_ADDRESS, {
               uluna: 1, // parse baseAsset from network object and use here (e.g.`[baseAsset]`)
             }),
           ],
         };

         const tx = await wallet.post(transactionMsg);
         setTxResult(tx);
       } catch (error) {
         setTxError(
           'Error: ' + (error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)),
         );
       }
     }, [connectedWallet, wallet]);

     return (
       <>
         {connectedWallet && !txResult && !txError && (
           <button onClick={testTx}>Send 1USD to {TEST_TO_ADDRESS}</button>
         )}

         {txResult && <>{JSON.stringify(txResult, null, 2)}</>}
         {txError && <pre>{txError}</pre>}
       </>
     );
   }
   export default Tx;
   ```

   <Admonition type="note" icon="📝">
     Because all coins are denominated in micro-units, you will need to multiply
     any coins by $10^6$ . For example, 1000000 uluna = 1 LUNA.
   </Admonition>

3. Open `App.js` in your code editor and add `import Tx from './components/Tx'` to line 4, and ` <Tx />` to line 12. The whole file should look like the following:

   ```js
   import './App.css';
   import Connect from './components/Connect';
   import Query from './components/Query';
   import Tx from './components/Tx';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div className="App">
         <header className="App-header">
           <Connect />
           <Query />
           <Tx />
         </header>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

4. After refreshing your browser, you'll see a new **Send** button. Click the button to send your transaction. Your Station extension will ask you to confirm the transaction.
