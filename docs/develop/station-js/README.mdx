# station.js

station.js can be used to interact with the Terra blockchain within JavaScript runtimes, such as Node.js and the browser. station.js enables the following functionalities:

- Deserializing blockchain data into JavaScript objects with native data types and methods.
- Serializing objects back into a blockchain-compatible format.
- Providing access to the Terrad node API (LCD) from a JavaScript-based interface.
- Providing additional utilities, such as hash functions and key-signing algorithms.

Outside of the deprecation of the treasury, market, and oracle modules, station.js functionality remains relatively unchanged. There are a few additions to allow for legacy commands which are explained in the [Using Terra Classic](./terra-classic.mdx) page.
