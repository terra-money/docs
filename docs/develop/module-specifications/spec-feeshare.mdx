# FeeShare

<Admonition type="info" icon="ℹ️">

The FeeShare module is an open-source module created by the Juno network. This document is a stub and mainly covers Terra-specific notes on how it is used. Visit the [original documentation](https://docs.junonetwork.io/developer-guides/juno-modules/feeshare#registering-factory-contracts) for more information.

The FeeShare module enables contracts to share in the distribution of fees generated from contract transactions. Whenever a transaction occurs, a gas fee is incurred and distributed to validators via the [Distribution module](./spec-distribution.mdx). With FeeShare, a portion of this fee can be diverted back to an address specified by the contract the transaction originated from. In order to participate in fee sharing, contracts must be [registered with the module](../guides/register-feeshare.mdx). 

## Governance parameters

The following parameters can be adjusted by creating a [governance proposal](./spec-governance.mdx). 

| Key                        | Type        | Default Value    |
| :------------------------- | :---------- | :--------------- |
| `EnableFeeShare`           | bool        | `true`           |
| `DeveloperShares`          | sdk.Dec     | `50%`            |
| `AllowedDenoms`            | []string{}  | `[]string(nil)`  |

### `EnableFeeShare` 

This parameter enables the module. When set to _`false`_, it will disable all feeshare capabilities. 

### `DeveloperShares` 

This parameter denotes the percentage of fees diverted back to a registered contract. When set at 50%, half of all fees generated will be sent to the withdraw address specified by the registered contract. 

### `AllowedDenoms` 

This parameter specifies which denominations will be diverted back to a registered contract. If empty, all denominations available as fees will be diverted.

## Registering a contract

To register a new or existing contract, follow the [FeeShare registration guide](../guides/register-feeshare.mdx).
