# Court delegations

Consider the following options to help improve your visibility and make yourself known to potential delegators.

## Set up a website

Set up a website so that current or potential delegators can look up information about your validator. It is recommended that you include a section in which you can instruct Terra delegators on how they can delegate Luna tokens.

## Introduce yourself on Discord

Join the [Terra Validators Discord](https://terra.sc/validatordiscord) channel, and introduce yourself.

## Submit a validator profile

Submit a [Validator Profile](https://github.com/terra-money/validator-profiles) to make it official.

## Put a thumbnail on Station

Create a [Keybase Account](https://keybase.io/) follow the Keybase instructions to set up a PGP key, and upload a profile picture.
For the sake of consistency, it is recommended to use the same GitHub account to verify both your Keybase and validator profiles.

Now, link your Keybase profile to your validator. Open your validator terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
terrad tx staking edit-validator \
    --identity="keybase identity"
```
