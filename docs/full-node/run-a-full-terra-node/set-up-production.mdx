# Set up a production environment

Use this guide to set up and manage a production-level full Terra node.

For information about running a validator node, visit the [validator guide](../manage-a-terra-validator/README.mdx).

## Create a dedicated user

Although Terrad does not require a super user account, during the setup process you'll need super user permissions to create and modify some files. It is strongly recommended to use a normal user when running Terrad.

## Increase the maximum files Terrad can open

Terrad can open 1024 files at a time by default. It is recommended that you increase this amount.

Modify `/etc/security/limits.conf`[\*](https://linux.die.net/man/5/limits.conf) to increase the amount, where `nofile` is the number of files Terrad can open at a time.

```bash
# If you have never changed this system config or your system is fresh, most of this file will be commented
# ...
*                soft    nofile          65535   # Uncomment the following two lines at the bottom
*                hard    nofile          65535   # Change the default values to ~65535
# ...
```

# Run the server as a daemon

Terrad must be running at all times. It is recommended that you register Terrad as a `systemd` service so that it will be started automatically when the system reboots.

## Register Terrad as a service

1. Create a service definition file in `/etc/systemd/system/terrad.service`.

   **Example**:

   ```bash
   [Unit]
   Description=Terra Daemon
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=<TERRA_USER>
   ExecStart=<PATH_TO_TERRAD>/terrad start
   Restart=on-abort

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target

   [Service]
   LimitNOFILE=65535
   ```

2. Modify the `Service` section according to your environment:

   - Enter the user (likely your username, unless you created a user specifically for Terrad).
   - Enter the path to the Terrad executable. `<PATH_TO_TERRAD>` is likely `/home/<YOUR_USER>/go/bin/terrad` or `/usr/go/bin`. Confirm this with `whereis terrad`.
   - Make sure you made the correct edits to `/etc/security/limits.conf`.

3. Run `systemctl daemon-reload` followed by `systemctl enable terrad`. This will register Terrad as a system service and run the program upon startup.

4. Now start the serivce with `systemctl start terrad`.

### Controlling the service

Use `systemctl` to start, stop, and restart the service:

```bash
# Check health
systemctl status terrad
# Start
systemctl start terrad
# Stop
systemctl stop terrad
# Restart
systemctl restart terrad
```

### Access logs

Use `journalctl -t` to access entire logs, entire logs in reverse, and the latest and continuous log.

```bash
# Entire log reversed
journalctl -t terrad -r
# Entire log
journalctl -t terrad
# Latest and continuous
journalctl -t terrad -f
```
