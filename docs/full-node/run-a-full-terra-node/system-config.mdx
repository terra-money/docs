# System Configuration

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️" title="Recommended operating systems">

This guide has been tested against Linux distributions only. To ensure a successful production environment setup, consider using a Linux system.

</Admonition>

Running a full Terra node is a resource-intensive process that requires a persistent server. If you want to use Terra without downloading the entire blockchain, use [Station](https://station.terra.money/). If you want to set up a local, WASM-enabled, private testnet for smart contracts, visit [install LocalTerra](../../develop/localterra/README.mdx).

## Hardware Requirements

The **minimum** requirements for running a Terra full node are:

| Network                                                                | CPU cores      | RAM   | Disk                       | BANDWIDTH |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----- | -------------------------- | --------- |
| [`phoenix-1`](join-a-network.mdx#join-a-public-network)                | 4 (+4 threads) | 32 GB | 2 TB (SSD 2000 MB/s R/W)   | 300 Mbps  |
| [`pisco-1`](join-a-network.mdx#join-a-public-network)                  | 2 (+2 threads) | 16 GB | 500 GB (SSD 1000 MB/s R/W) | 150 Mbps  |
| [`localterra`](https://github.com/terra-money/LocalTerra)              | 2              | 4 GB  | 20 GB (SSD 500 MB/s R/W)   | N/A       |
| [`private-network`](join-a-network.mdx#set-up-a-local-private-network) | 1              | 2 GB  | 20 GB (SSD 500 MB/s R/W)   | N/A       |

As the network grows, the minimum hardware requirements will also grow. It is recommended that you monitor the system so you can prevent it from running out of resources.

## Prerequisites

- [Golang v1.18+ linux/amd64](https://go.dev/dl/)

<details> 
<summary> Installing Go for MacOS & Linux </summary>
<p>

Go releases can be found here: [ https://go.dev/dl/ ](https://go.dev/dl/)

In your browser, you can right-click the correct release (V1.18) and then click on `Copy Link Address`.

```bash
# 1. Download the archive

wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.18.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Optional: remove previous /go files:

sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go

# 2. Unpack:

sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.18.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# 3. Add the path to the go-binary to your system path:
# (for this to persist, add this line to your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc or  ~/.zshrc)

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

# 4. Verify your installation:

go version

# go version go1.18.2 linux/amd64

```

</p>

- Linux users: `sudo apt-get install -y build-essential`

## Commonly used ports

Terrad uses the following TCP ports. Toggle their settings to match your environment.

Most validators will only need to open the following port:

- `26656`: The default port for the P2P protocol. This port is used to communicate with other nodes and must be open to join a network. However, it does not have to be open to the public. For validator nodes, [configuring `persistent_peers`](updates-and-additional.mdx#additional-settings) and closing this port to the public are recommended.

Additional ports:

- `1317`: The default port for the [Lite Client Daemon](../../develop/guides/start-lcd.mdx) (LCD), which can be executed by `terrad rest-server`. The LCD provides an HTTP RESTful API layer to allow applications and services to interact with your Terrad instance through RPC. For usage examples, see [Terra REST API](https://phoenix-lcd.terra.dev/swagger/). You don't need to open this port unless you have use for it.

- `26660`: The default port for interacting with the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) database, which can be used to monitor the environment. In the default configuration, this port is not open.

- `26657`: The default port for the RPC protocol. Because this port is used for querying and sending transactions, it must be open for serving queries from Terrad.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️">

Do not open port `26657` to the public unless you plan to run a public node.
