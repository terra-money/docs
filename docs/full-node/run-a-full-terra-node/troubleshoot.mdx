# Reset and troubleshooting

## Complete reset

Occasionally you may need to perform a comlpete reset of your node due to data corruption or misconfiguration. Resetting will remove all data in `~/.terra/data` and the addressbook in `~/.terra/config/addrbook.json` and reset the node to genesis state.

To perform a complete reset of your Terrad state, execute the following command in your terminal:

```
terrad tendermint unsafe-reset-all
```

Running this command successfully will produce the following log:

```
[ INF ] Removed existing address book file=/home/user/.terra/config/addrbook.json
[ INF ] Removed all blockchain history dir=/home/user/.terra/data
[ INF ] Reset private validator file to genesis state keyFile=/home/user/.terra/config/priv_validator_key.json stateFile=/home/user/.terra/data/priv_validator_state.json
```

After resetting, make sure the addressbook contains peer addresses and is in the correct spot. If not, [download an adressbook](join-a-network.mdx#1-select-a-network) and place it in `~/.terra/config/`.

### Change Genesis

To change the genesis version, delete `~/.terra/config/genesis.json`.

You can recreate a genesis version via the following steps:

```bash
 terrad add-genesis-account $(terrad keys show <account-name> -a) 100000000uluna,1000usd
 terrad gentx <account-name> 10000000uluna --chain-id=<network-name>
 terrad collect-gentxs
```

### Reset personal data

<Admonition type="danger" icon="ðŸ”¥">

You may be unable to use your node and its associated accounts after changing your personal data. Do not perform this action unless your node is disposable.

</Admonition>

To change your personal data to a pristine state, delete both `~/.terra/config/priv_validator_state.json` and `~/.terra/config/node_key.json`.

### Node health

A healthy node will have the following files in place and populated:

- Addressbook `~/.terra/config/addrbook.json`
- Genesis file `~/.terra/config/genesis.json`
- Validator state `~/.terra/config/priv_validator_state.json`
- Node key `~/.terra/config/node_key.json`

### Resync

You can proceed to [resync manually](sync.mdx#sync-from-genesis) or [using a snapshot](sync.mdx#quicksync).
