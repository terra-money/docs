# Sync

This guide will walk you through how to [sync the chain from genesis](#sync-from-genesis) or use a [snapshot](#sync-from-snapshot) for a quicker sync.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️" title="Setup for successful sync">

Before you attempt to sync your node, confirm that you have properly set up your [system configuration](./system-config.mdx#system-configuration) and [built Terra core](./build-terra-core.mdx#get-the-terra-core-source-code).

</Admonition>

There are two types of syncs you can perform. 

- [Sync from snapshot](#sync-from-snapshot): Quickly sync from a recent snapshot of the chain.
- [Sync from genesis](#sync-from-genesis): Sync from the chain's genesis. 

To speed up a sync for testing purposes, you can [forego checks](#fast-sync-for-testing). 

## Sync from snapshot

You can significantly accelerate the synchronization process by providing terrad with a recent snapshot of the network state. Snapshots are made publicly available by members of the Terra community, such as [Polkachu Phoenix mainnet snapshot](https://polkachu.com/state_sync/terra)or the [Polkachu Pisco testnet snapshot](https://polkachu.com/testnets/terra). These snapshots are provided by Polkachu, and are not maintained as part of this documentation.

### Before using snapshots

Certain files will need to be absent or deleted before downloading a snapshot. A quicksync replaces blockchain data with a custom snapshot. For most use cases, a "pruned" version is adequate. Pruned versions will have certain transactions removed from the archive to improve node performance. If you are running a node for archival purposes, you will want an `archive` or `default` download.

### Snapshot sync

1. After choosing the appropriate download type, examine your node and ensure that `.terra/data` is empty.

  **Example**:

  ```sh Terminal

  6:22PM INF Removed all blockchain history dir=/home/ubuntu/.terra/data

  ```

  <Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️">

  If you are a validator, ensure that you do not remove your private key.

  Example of a removed private key:

  ```sh Terminal
  6:22PM INF Reset private validator file to genesis state keyFile=/home/ubuntu/.terra/config/priv_validator_key.json stateFile=/home/ubuntu/.terra/data/priv_validator_state.json
  ```

  </Admonition>

2. If you have an address book downloaded, you may keep it. Otherwise, you will need to download the [appropriate addressbook](./join-a-network.mdx#join-a-public-network). Then you can run the following:

  ```sh Terminal
  terrad start
  terrad status
  # It will take a few seconds for terrad to start.
  ```

## Sync from genesis

The process for syncing your full node from genesis will differ between the Pisco testnet and Phoenix mainnet networks. For the testnet, follow the [Pisco testnet sync instructions](#pisco-testnet). For the mainnet, follow the [Pheonix mainnet sync instructions](#pheonix-mainnet). 

### Pisco testnet

To sync a Pisco testnet node, you will need to use version `v2.0.0-rc.0` of terrad up until the block height of `838500`. To sync your node from block `838500` until block `2777777`, you will need to use version `v2.1.0-beta.1` of terrad. From block `2777777` until `4712048`, use version `v2.2.0` of terrad. From block `4712048` until `6272928`, use version `v2.3.0-rc.0` of terrad. From block `6272928` to until block `7432000`, use `v2.4.0-rc5`. From block `7432000` onwards, use `v2.5.0-rc5`. 

1. To switch to version `v2.0.0-rc.0` of terrad, [change into your `core` directory](./build-terra-core.mdx#get-the-terra-core-source-code) and execute the following commands in your terminal:

```sh Terminal
git checkout v2.0.0-rc.0
make install
```

After running these commands, make sure that you have switched to the correct version of terrad by running the following command:

```sh Terminal
terrad version
```

The result of this command should be `v2.0.0-rc.0`.

2. After you have the correct terrad version, you will need to download the genesis file for Pisco in the terrad config directory:

```sh Terminal
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terra-money/testnet/master/pisco-1/genesis.json -O ~/.terra/config/genesis.json
```

3. Next, [update the `persistent_peers` setting](https://polkachu.com/testnets/terra/peers) with a list of stable persistent peers in your `config.toml` file.

4. Now, you can start the syncing process:

```sh Terminal
terrad start
```

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️" title="Sync start times">

Nodes take at least an hour to start syncing. This wait time is normal. Before troubleshooting a sync, please wait an hour for the sync to start.

</Admonition>

Syncing will halt at block `838500`, at which point you will need to change the version of terrad and then resume the syncing process.

5. To sync your Pisco testnet node from block `838500` to block `2777777` you will need to navigate to the `core` directory and change your terrad version to `v2.1.0-beta.1`.

```sh Terminal
git checkout v2.1.0-beta.1
make install
```

Again, make sure that you have switched to the correct version of terrad by running the following command:

```sh Terminal
terrad version
```

The result of this command should be `v2.1.0`.

6. Again, you can resume the syncing process:

```sh Terminal
terrad start
```

Syncing will halt at block `2777777`, at which point you will need to change the version of terrad and then resume the syncing process.

7. To sync your Pisco testnet node from block `2777777` to block `4712048`, you will need to navigate to the `core` directory and change your terrad version to `v2.2.0`.

```sh Terminal
git checkout v2.2.0
make install
```

Again, make sure that you have switched to the correct version of terrad by running the following command:

```sh Terminal
terrad version
```

The result of this command should be `v2.2.0`.

8. Now, you can resume the syncing process:

```sh Terminal
terrad start
```

Syncing will halt at block `4712048`, at which point you will need to change the version of terrad and then resume the syncing process.

9. To sync your Pisco testnet node from block `4712048` to the most recent block, you will need to navigate to the `core` directory and change your terrad version to `v2.3.0-rc.0`.

```sh Terminal
git checkout v2.3.0-rc.0
make install
```

Again, make sure that you have switched to the correct version of terrad by running the following command:

```sh Terminal
terrad version
```

The result of this command should be `v2.3.0-rc.0`.

10. Now, you can resume the syncing process:

```sh Terminal
terrad start
```

Syncing will halt at block `6272928`, at which point you will need to change the version of terrad and then resume the syncing process.

11. To sync your Pisco testnet node from block `6272928` to block `7432000`, you will need to navigate to the `core` directory and change your terrad version to `v2.4.0-rc5`.

```sh Terminal
git checkout v2.4.0-rc5
make install
```

Again, make sure that you have switched to the correct version of terrad by running the following command:

```sh Terminal
terrad version
```

The result of this command should be `v2.4.0`.

12. Now, you can resume the syncing process:

```sh Terminal
terrad start
```
Syncing will halt at block `7432000`, at which point you will need to change the version of terrad and then resume the syncing process.

13. To sync your Pisco testnet node from block `7432000` to the most recent block, you will need to navigate to the `core` directory and change your terrad version to `v2.5.0-rc5`.

```sh Terminal
git checkout v2.5.0-rc5
make install
```

Again, make sure that you have switched to the correct version of terrad by running the following command:

```sh Terminal
terrad version
```

The result of this command should be `v2.5.0`.

14. Now, you can resume and finalize the syncing process:

```sh Terminal
terrad start
```

From here, you can [monitor the sync](#monitor-the-sync). Make sure to check on your node periodically to ensure optimal performance.

### Phoenix mainnet

If you would like to sync your node using the Phoenix mainnet, you will need to use version `v2.0.0` of terrad up until the block height of `890000`. To sync your node from block `890000` to block `2979805`, you will need to use version `v2.1.1` of terrad. From block `2979805` until block `4711800`, use version `v2.2.0` of terrad until block `4711800`.  From block `4711800` until block `5994365`, use version `v2.3.0`. From block `5994365` onwards, use version `v2.4.0` to complete the sync. 

1. To switch to version `v2.0.0` of terrad, [change into your `core` directory](./build-terra-core.mdx#get-the-terra-core-source-code) and execute the following commands in your terminal:

```sh Terminal
git checkout v2.0.0
make install
```

After running these commands, make sure that you have switched to the correct version of terrad by running the following command:

```sh Terminal
terrad version
```

The result of this command should be `v2.0.0`.

2. After you have the correct terrad version, you will need to download the genesis file for Phoenix in the terrad config directory:

```sh Terminal
wget https://phoenix-genesis.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/genesis.json -O ~/.terra/config/genesis.json
```

3. Next, download the `addrbook.json` file containing a list of stable persistent peers into the `~/.terra/config/` directory:

```sh Terminal
wget https://snapshots.polkachu.com/addrbook/terra/addrbook.json -O ~/.terra/config/addrbook.json
```

4. Now, you can start the syncing process:

```sh Terminal
terrad start
```

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️" title="Sync start times">

7. To sync your Phoenix mainnet node from block `2979805` to block `4711800`, you will need to navigate to the `core` directory and change your terrad version to `v2.2.0`.

```sh Terminal
git checkout v2.2.0
make install
```

Again, make sure that you have switched to the correct version of terrad by running the following command:

```sh Terminal
terrad version
```

The result of this command should be `v2.2.0`.

8. again, you can resume the syncing process:

```sh Terminal
terrad start
```

Syncing will halt at block `4711800`, at which point you will need to change the version of terrad and then resume the syncing process.

### Fast-sync for testing

Sometimes you may want to sync faster by foregoing checks. You may do so by adding the following flag to the `terrad start` command.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️">

The following command should only be used by advanced users in non-production environments:

```sh Terminal
terrad start --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants
```

</Admonition>

## Monitor the sync

Your node is catching up with the network by replaying all the transactions from genesis and recreating the blockchain state locally. You can verify this process by checking the `latest_block_height` in the `SyncInfo` of the `terrad status` response:

```json Response
  {
    "SyncInfo": {
        "latest_block_height": "42", <-----
        "catching_up"        : true
    },
  ...
  }
```

Compare this height to the **Latest Blocks** by checking the API for the latest block heights on [Phoenix](https://phoenix-lcd.terra.dev/blocks/latest), or [Pisco](https://pisco-lcd.terra.dev/blocks/latest) to see your progress.

## Sync complete

You can tell that your node is in sync with the network when `SyncInfo.catching_up` in the `terrad status` response returns `false` and the `latest_block_height` corresponds to the public network blockheight found on the API for either [Phoenix](https://phoenix-lcd.terra.dev/blocks/latest), or [Pisco](https://pisco-lcd.terra.dev/blocks/latest).

```sh Terminal
terrad status
```

**Example**:

```json Example
  {
    "SyncInfo": {
        "latest_block_height": "7356350",
        "catching_up"        : false
    },
  ...
  }
```

Validators can view the status of the network using [Terra Finder](https://finder.terra.money).

## Congratulations!

You've successfully joined a network as a full node operator. If you are a validator, continue to [manage a Terra validator](../manage-a-terra-validator/README.mdx) for next steps.
